description: This photo sequence shows the "gobbling droplets" phenomenon. A jet of
  liquid is unstable because of surface tension and usually breaks into small droplets.
  The addition of minute quantities of polymeric molecules provides an additive elastic
  stress which stabilizes the liquid column. In this situation the terminal droplet
  has the time to gobble many of its incoming neighbors before its detachment. Photo
